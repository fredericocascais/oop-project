 * The Simulation package contains classes for simulating an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm on a graph.
 * It includes the Simulation class, which manages the simulation process and events, and the InputParameters class, which holds the input parameters for the simulation.
 * The package also includes classes for representing the graph, ants, pheromones, and other simulation entities.
